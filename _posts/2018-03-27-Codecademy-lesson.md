**Codecademy lesson**

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>What happened:
In this lesson we did more codecademy. In codecademy I did some more of the shopping topic. This basically meant I learned how to make dictionaries and so was able to store food in it. That's what was supposed to happen, what instead happened was there was a glitch so that even when I did get the answer, it was wrong because of a certain glitch in the system where a line of code had to be spelled differently in a way that we hadn’t even learned. This took up a lot of the lesson for me trying to go through different possibilities for what I was allowed to do and after a certain point I gave up and asked the teacher who explained what happened.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>How could I improve:
I think that while I couldn’t answer some of the questions, some I could but it still took me time. I think that a lot of time could have been saved if I’d gone back through past pieces of work or looked online for the answer because it’s better to move on to different questions rather than just fumble on one question. It’s also important because sometimes I admit that in my annoyance and complete lack of knowledge I sometimes used the solution button when it would’ve been a lot better if I’d tried to use the internet or past exercises to help me as it would’ve also unforced my memory.</td>
