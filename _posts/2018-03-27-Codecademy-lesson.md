**_Codecademy lesson 2.0_**

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>What happened:
In short we carried on the work we did last lesson on codecademy. To go into more detail I worked on and finished up on my 'student becomes the teacher' course and so moved on to ‘loops and functions’. I think the ‘student becomes the teacher’ course was quite helpful because it introduced some rather difficult mechanics in my view and made me have to understand them to get through so while it did take me a considerably long time to finish the course, it improved my mind and helped me learn.
I think the next section, the section on ‘loops and functions’ it was mostly just a really good recap and showed me how I’d basically forgotten almost everything about functions but this section gave me a good refresher which I found very useful. Also, this lesson was quite useful as (similar to the last point) I found out that I do need to go back to previous exercises otherwise I won't be able to do future lessons properly, absorbing as much information as I'll just be trying to remember what so and so does and how to do it. </td>

    <td>What I could have improved:
I think that the major thing I need to improve upon is the fact that I need to go back to past sections to recap on how to do certain things as I am starting to majorly struggle without doing this. This will unfortunately mean for me (or fortunately) that I will have to do extra work so as to be able to continue codecademy at my current rate as well as going through past exercises again. </td>
