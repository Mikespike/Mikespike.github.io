**Binary**

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>What happened:
This lesson was more of a listening lesson, opposite to the more practical lesson last time. However, mr keen was somehow able to make the lesson more exciting and giving us more feedback by asking a lot of questions which I thought was a lot better than what he could've gone.
I did learn quite a lot, like how computers do negative and fractions in binary and the problems they face. I also found this lesson was like a well needed recap of what we’d done in year 7.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>How could I have improved:
I think there are 2 things I could’ve done better. First I think I could have tried a bit of binary myself on some website I find, just to make sure I know how to do it. Second I think I could’ve involved myself more as he asked a lot of questions and though I raised my hand for a lot of them, I could have done it more.</td>
