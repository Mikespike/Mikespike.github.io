    <td>Progress:
This weeks work was a little harder than any other week in my opinion. Using wires and electronics is a lot different from doing code on a computer and we often just resorted to looking at the pictures and trying to copy them. This often meant that my partner and I often got into arguments about what to do at certain times. I think because we argued we could have gotten a lot more done than we did.

We only completed about 2-3 pages which wasn't the best we’ve ever done (the worst we’ve ever done) but also this seems to be the hardest couple of pages we’ve ever done. I think I would have liked to do more and I will make sure we do more in the upcoming week. 
General Summary:
We didn’t do much progress but we learnt some lessons about teamwork.
