    <td>Details:
Unfortunately we weren't able to finish the breadboard section because our breadboard was broken. This would also explain why nothing was working last week because we did try many options and got a little bit frustrated yet nothing would work.

Instead we moved onto the robot arm which was tons of fun. It took us the whole lesson but we were able to get the robot arm to move with commands and it was surprisingly easy. The code wasn't too lengthy and it also wasn't very complicated, I could understand most if not all of the code. 

Finally, I was quite happy with this lesson because not only did we complete all the work but we also put it onto my memory stick with help from the teacher.

Overall summary:
We have done a lot of work and are moving onto future tasks like making snake which will take the best part of many lessons. The robot arm was very cool.
