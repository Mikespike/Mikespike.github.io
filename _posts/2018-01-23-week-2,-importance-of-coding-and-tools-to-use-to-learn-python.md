**Importance of coding and tools to use to learn python**

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>What happened?
The basic summary of this lesson was it was about the importance of logic and learning IT which for me is a very important topic but it may have gone on for a little too long, but this is just my opinion of course. 
We went over facts like how in McDonalds, well let's just say they’re not the smartest hens in the roost. Then of course there’s the fact that people who learn computer science are more likely to get a better high paying job, probably because about 1% of them become multi billionaires. However, I am very happy with how the first part  of the lesson turned out.
Then the next lesson was where we put some of our skills to the test, which was quite enjoyable, and progressed through a basic python course. Somehow I noticed people struggled on some of the first lessons, even though it literally told you what to do.</td>

    <td>How can I improve?
Unfortunately, I was not able to get too far on the python because half-way through one of the questions, my computer had a breakdown. In other words, It wouldn’t do anything I told it to do and I was getting a little annoyed.
What I did to fix this problem was to go to lunch, which did a lot to help. What I should have done was change my computer and carry on as that was vital time where the lesson’s information was still fresh in my mind.</td>
