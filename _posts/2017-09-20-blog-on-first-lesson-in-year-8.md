    <td>Did I reach my target?
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>I think I did, what set me back was the confusion of whether the lesson was theater or IT and this means I missed half the lesson and wasn't fully aware of the task.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think that being able to talk to the kids next to me was a big help because they came at the beginning of the lesson and so knew everything they had to do. This meant I didn't have too much problem understanding what I had to do and hopefully I can help them later on.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think the main thing that limited my learning was the fact that I missed half the lesson as I missed part of the work and also the full explanation of everything we to do, so even though I was told the main plot, it was a summary. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think to improve my learning Iâ€™d go to coding club. This will allow me to ask my own personal questions and get a private session with the teacher.</td>
