**Blog on lesson 4**

**4/10/17**

Goal:

To carry on the work from last week and get on to section 5.

Progress:

To start with we made some mistakes. The reason we couldn't get past a certain section of the work from last week was because we were doing it all wrong. Instead of seeing the answer pop up on the screen when we loaded the code, we had to input the data after we’d loaded it and then it would store it. This was a lot cooler than what I’d originally expected as we didn’t have to delve into the code to give the data and it was easily changeable.

Once we knew what we had to do, me and my partner went through the steps reasonably quicker and were able to mess around a bit with the code. Messing around with the code made us a little slower but, I do think it made us learn the actual information better, rather than just copying it down straight from the book.

It was actually in a way useful not knowing what to do at a certain point. This is because we tried many different techniques and so dived deeper into the code, both new and old. As well of course we practiced perseverance which is one of the school mottos.

Finally, we did in the end get to th the next stage and I'm excited. In stage 5 we get to learn how to draw things, pixel by pixel and we know this because we tried it a bit. I found it a lot more confusing, but equally clever, than I thought it was going to be. This is because we have to use binary to work out which pixel goes where using addition and rows etc.

Overall, I'm enjoying my experience in IT and I’m excited for the following lesson.
