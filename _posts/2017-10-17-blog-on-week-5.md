    <td>Progress:
We quickly completed section 5 as it was quite short (but fun) and went on to stage 6. In stage 5 we learnt about how to draw pixelated characters and how to position them. It was very useful how we could position them because it allowed me to make a simple teleportation animation where the object teleporting actually changed colours and shape, it was quite cool in my opinion.

Section 6 was basically a recap section. It brought together all the information we've so far looked at and combined it. In the section, we were able to make a guessing game from 1 - 100. The game seemed to have a lot of code and looking at how complicated a game that is and the amount of code it has, it pales me to think about how much code is used for complicated computer games.
