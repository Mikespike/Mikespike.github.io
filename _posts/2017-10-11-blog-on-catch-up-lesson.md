**Blog on catch up lesson**

**Goal:**

To make up the lesson I missed by doing work outside of class.

**Progress:**

My progress was directed at fixing my blog. My blog at the time wasn't working so instead of doing the lesson I spent a coding club lesson trying to fix my blog. I tried many different solutions but it seemed like whatever I did, it wouldnâ€™t work.

I ended up having to ask for help as whatever I tried, it wouldn't work. First I asked some friends and other kids. They suggested many options but none of them worked. After a few days of trial and error, I was getting quite annoyed.

I decided, the only option for me to fix my blog was ask the teacher, so ask I did. He looked at my code and told me that the jekyll engine was broken. This meant I had to close down my website and start a new one. Luckily it didn't take too long and in no time, my blog was once again working.
