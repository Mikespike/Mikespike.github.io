**THE FINAL LESSON**

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>All in all, I am quite sad that this term of IT is finishing. I've quite enjoyed it and it has brought challenges that I have so far never done. I have come close to doing it because for my 10th birthday I got a raspberry pie unfortunately ended up being faulty and so I couldn’t even use, however because of this class, I was able to use one.
This lesson was different from the others because rather than working on our raspberry pies we were told to work on our github blogs. The challenge in this lesson was to was to make the back of our blogs snowing. This I found out could be done in 2 ways. The first option was to make a video, and that’s what I tried but there were unfortunately 2 problems with this: a)You have to click the play button for the video. There were extremely few videos where it was just snowing and b)There was often something else actually going on. The second option was to make an animation which I found was the best option but I didn’t do the pros of this is that it will always 
play and only snow. So this meant I had to put in extra time to change my video but overall I’m not too sad.</td>
