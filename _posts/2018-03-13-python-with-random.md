**python with random**

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>What happened:
In this lesson we looked at the random command which is a very useful piece of code to do, as it says, random. I found this probably the coolest piece of code we've looked at so far because if you then integrate it into a loop then you can make some very interesting pieces of code which I had a lot of fun with. 
I ended up having so much fun messing around that I actually that I actually (sort of) broke repl.it by making a very strange loop problem that caused it to make its own very peculiar shape, made of circles which had no logic that I or anyone else could see but it looked very cool. 
Finally we learned how to make more than one turtle which I still haven’t fully used to my advantage but I plan on doing so very soon. This I feel will make a great addition to the loop and random combo but as I said, I am yet to find out.   </td>

  <tr>
    <td>How can I improve:
I think that to improve, I could understand my work better. As I said above, I created a very strange piece of code by accident and I didn’t really stop to try to understand it but rather decided that there was a reason, albeit a strange one, to why it worked/happened rather than truly question it. I feel like even though this is an obscure thing I’m not likely going to need, if I were to properly understand it, then I could replicate it and maybe make more with it in future lessons as I learn more skills.</td>
