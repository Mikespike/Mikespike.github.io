    <td>Details:
In the lesson me and my partner were lucky enough to get an extra person in our group because their partner was not available anymore. This meant we had some more hands working which actually made everything a little bit more efficient. We created our own rota to say who's go it was and it worked very well never causing one issue.

We also began the game Snake and that was a very long-winded process. Although we were very efficient that lesson, we only completed 2 out of the 7 pages we had to finish so that means itâ€™ll take about 3-4 lessons to complete the Snake game. Now I do want to make the game and I have nothing against it but it may be better to do smaller games but to be honest, Snake is quite a small game  and I understand that it combines all of the skills we learnt. 

Overall Summary:
We spent the entire lesson writing out a large amount of code.</td>
