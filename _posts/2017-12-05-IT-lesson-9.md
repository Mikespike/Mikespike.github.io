**More On The Snake Game**

    <td>Details:
This lesson was a little different because our partner from last week was with another group so we had to change our routine slightly and so I think that this may have caused a little bit of difficulty.
There was also the fact that for some reason parts of the code didn't work for us and so we did simply continue, but, this could be a problem for the future. There was also the problem with how the book was written that made it a little confusing, going back to past areas and then inserting code in those chosen areas.
