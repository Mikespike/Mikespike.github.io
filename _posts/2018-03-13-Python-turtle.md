**Python Turtle**

*21/2/18*

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>What happened
This lesson involved a lot of learning as in none of us knew a thing and because of that Mr Keen was at the front a lot explaining a lot of it. Though he did a good job explaining in my view and due to that, I did learn a lot which made the lesson worthwhile.
I did enjoy this lesson because we learned how to do some very cool things making some very cool and very unusual things. This is one of the main things I enjoyed because Mr Keen showed us the basics but then allowed us to expand from there which allowed us to test our creativity and test our skills from there.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>How could I have improved
I think that in the lesson I could have stretched the boundaries more. What I did was I basically just tried to make cool things using the same things from the lessons. What I should have done and what I was doing as homework was I should have tried making other shapes or making more than one turtle or at least trying to make some more complicated pieces of code, even if they didn't work.</td>
