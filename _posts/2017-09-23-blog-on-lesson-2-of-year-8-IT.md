    <td>In Depth Lesson description: 
At the beginning I was unsure of what was going to happen, unknown to the fact we were about to do one of my favourite subjects. As the lesson plan goes I chose my partner and fumbled around with the plugs etc. There was a moment of hesitation but it was sorted when we switched on the power for the cable.

The reasons why I loved this subject is that it was about creativity as well as logic and in the subject we got almost complete freedom over what we could do. This wasn't playing games and doing that sort of thing but the freedom to be able to code what we wanted and make the website  do what we wanted and show what we wanted. 

All in all I very much enjoyed this subject. However what I didnâ€™t realize is how far we were allowed to go so next subject I want to go many subjects forward and hopefully catch up with the prosperous people from last lesson.
