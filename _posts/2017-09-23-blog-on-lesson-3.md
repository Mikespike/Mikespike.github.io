Goal:To get to section 4.

Achieved: I unfortunately did not achieve this goal but I did get close, getting halfway through section 3.

In Depth Lesson description: Me and my partner quickly raced through section 2 variables. It wasn't very hard and we quite quickly got all the code to work. As well as this we didnâ€™t mess around much while doing section 2 so we got it done relatively quickly.

Section 3 presented some challenges. The work got increasingly difficult and even simple problems started taking a long time.  My partner unfortunately gave up after a few hurdles and at times I too was very close to giving up but we persevered and we got quite far.

Some challenges that faced me was focusing on the wrong problems and not trying to fix the right things. This was very hard to fix as it was hard to know where the problem was at the time. The only really options (for me) was to mentally order the pieces of code in terms of importance to the section I was doing and hope for the best.
