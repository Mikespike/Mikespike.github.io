**Same old, same old**

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>This week did not unfortunately bring many new obstacles or challenges. Once again we copied from the book and we added another 20 or so lines but in terms of the work we actually did, I didn't really face any new problems. 

One thing that did turn out new is the fact that more than one group finished. Now I take this with a grain of salt because most people were saying that the two groups that did supposedly finish loaded up a pre saved document which seems very likely as compared with the rest of the class, I donâ€™t think they are skilled enough at IT to be able to get so much work done.</td>
