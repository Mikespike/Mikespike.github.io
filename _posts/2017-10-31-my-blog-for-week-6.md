**Blog on lesson 6**

**Goal:**

*To complete section 6*

**Progress:**

Progress was slow going, there was a lot to write down and the majority of the lesson was a little tedious with me saying out a list of words and figures. The end result was satisfying because it meant all our hard work was finally shown off. 

Normally when we complete a section of code, we mess around a little with it which was no different this time. That took the rest of the lesson but i think that overall it was a success. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I greatly enjoy this topic and I hope to be able to carry on next term with the same topic. I heard rumors about what we might be doing and I am very excited if those rumours are true.  

**Extra:** I'm not sure if I was on section 6 or section 7 as my memory isn’t great. I looked back at my last work but I’m not sure if that’s wrong as well.
